# Advent of Code 2022 - sam's extremely cursed solutions

Having never tried code golf before (and beind extremely lazy), I'm gonna try to solve them using as few characters of python3 code as possible (known as code golf - see <https://github.com/samboyer/adventofcode.git>).

Will I get bored 10 days in and give up again? probably yes

## To-do

- work out how to automate the minification process
  - automatically apply the 2:1 or 3:1 compressors when a saving can be made (<https://code.golf/wiki/langs/python>)
