# Advent of Code 2022 - sam's extremely cursed solutions

Having never tried code golf before (and being v lazy), I've rather impulsively decided to solve them using as few characters of python3 code as possible (i.e. code golf - see <https://github.com/samboyer/adventofcode.git>).

Will I get bored 10 days in and give up again? probably yes

## To-do

- automatically apply the 2:1 or 3:1 compressors when a saving can be made (<https://code.golf/wiki/langs/python>)
